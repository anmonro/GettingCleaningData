The structure of the scripts is defined as follows:
  
  - Set directory and download dataset
  
  - Load datasets with read.table function
  
  - Merge training and test datasets to create one dataset.
    Here I use rbind function to join datasets
  
  - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    I use grep() and  gsub() functions to clear an rename variables.

  - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    I use tolower() and gsub() functions to convert to lower case and split the words to get the first letter capitalize

  - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    Change name of subject dataset and create a dataset with cbind function joining datasets.

  - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    Using doBy library I apply mean to subject+activity pair combinations.
